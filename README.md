# Predicting CO2 emissions using Machine Learning

<b>Project Description:</b><br>
The objective is to understand the relationship between energy consumption and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and to predict the emissions with various machine learning models to arrive at the most accurate prediction of CO2 emission. The input will be the data from EIA from different sectors like Industrial, Commercial, Transportation, Residential, Agriculture which then predicts the sectors that produce the most emissions.

<b>Prediction Models:</b><br>
    <li>Simple Linear Regression</li>
    <li>Multiple Linear Regression</li>
    <li>Random Forest</li>
    <li>AdaBoost ensemble</li>
    
<b>Tools & Technology:</b><br>

  Python 3.7 : Programming language <br>
  Pandas, NumPy : Python libraries to work with dataframe <br>
  Matplotlib : Data visualization <br>
  Scikit learn library : Build  machine learning models <br>
  Jupyter notebook : Open source IDE to create python <br>
